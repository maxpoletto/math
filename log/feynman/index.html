        From Wikipedia:
        <br>
        <p>
            While at Los Alamos National Laboratory working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman developed a bit-processing algorithm to compute the logarithm 
            that is similar to long division and was later used in the Connection Machine. The algorithm relies on the fact that every real number x where 1 &lt; x &lt; 2 
            can be represented as a product of distinct factors of the form 1 + 2<sup>−k</sup>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product P, starting with P = 1 and k = 1:
            if P · (1 + 2<sup>−k</sup>) &lt; x, then it changes P to P · (1 + 2<sup>−k</sup>). It then increases k by one regardless. The algorithm stops when k is large enough 
            to give the desired accuracy. Because log(x) is the sum of the terms of the form log(1 + 2<sup>−k</sup>) corresponding to those k for which the factor 
            1 + 2<sup>−k</sup> was included in the product P, log(x) may be computed by simple addition, using a table of log(1 + 2<sup>−k</sup>) for all k.
            Any base may be used for the logarithm table.

            Here I have slightly modified the algorithm to compute the natural logarithm of any number x &ge; 1.
